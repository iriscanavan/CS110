# Project02

This project is about analyzing Covid-19 data and calculating the 7-day average
for the county of San Francisco.

## Usage

```shell
python project2.py
```
This will create a file, `covid-SF.csv`. The file contains data in the following
order: the date, cumulative case count and the seven day average.

```shell
python covid_SF_plot.py
```
This will create a plot graph, using the matplotlib library. The date is on the
x-axis and the seven day average on the y-axis.

## Problems

I attempted to write my program in FP but encountered problems with organizing
the data. I decided to use OOP to group data in objects.
