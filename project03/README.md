# Project03

Write a python program that reads a file containing comma-separated data about
several pet animals, with each line containing data about one pet. Once read
in, the data is stored in a different object class depending on the type of
animal. After a data-object is created, it is added to one big pets list and all
operations are performed on that list.

## Problems

I wrote my CSV file wrong because I thought each value was seperated with a
comma and space.
